This is an implementation of Project 1A. The files included in this submission,
as reported by `tar tf *.tar.gz` are the following:

    README ............. This readme file
    Makefile ........... A Makefile to build the project
    lab1b-server.c ..... The stub C source code for the server
    lab1b-client.c ..... The stub C source code for the client
    lab1b-common.c ..... The main C source code
    lab1b-common.h ..... The declaration for the main functions

Additionally notes follow.

1. For simplicity, I have kept the single file approach. Most of the source code
is present in lab1b-common.c file. It contains many functions and struct
definitions local to the translation unit, and two exported functions,
`client_main` and `server_main`. Those are functions are also declared in
`lab1b-common.h`. Afterwards, the `lab1b-server.c` and `lab1b-client.c` simply
contain a very simple main function that just calls the relevant actual main
functions in `lab1b-common.c`.

2. I previously asked on Piazza whether it is acceptable to block on write(2). A
TA eventually responded, but I had already written much of the code assuming
otherwise. Therefore this program deals with all file descriptors in a
non-blocking manner.
