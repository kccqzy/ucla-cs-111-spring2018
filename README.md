# UCLA CS 111 Spring 2018 Problem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems in UCLA CS 111 (Spring 2018).
This is a class on operating systems, though rather innovatively, it teaches
concepts involved in operations without building a toy OS or writing any
kernel-mode code.

Please attempt questions on your own before looking at my solutions.
Specifically, because each year each Teaching Assistant may have different
grading criteria, what I write here may or may not be suitable for your
purposes.
