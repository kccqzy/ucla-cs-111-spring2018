This is an implementation of Project 0. The files included in this submission,
as reported by `tar tf *.tar.gz` are the following:

    README ............. This readme file
    lab0.c ............. The main C source code
    smoke_test.sh ...... A simple, non-comprehensive testing utility
    Makefile ........... A Makefile to build the project
    backtrace.png ...... A screenshot of a GDB session with backtrace
    breakpoint.png ..... A screenshot of a GDB session with a breakpoint

The smoke tests are particularly simple; they are in fact not comprehensive at
all, but rather just a basic test of the functionality. It includes six test
cases, namely:

1. Test when --input and --output are provided
2. Test when only --input is provided
3. Test when only --output is provided
4. Test large files
5. Test empty files
5. Test causing and catching segfaults

Interactions between different features are not tested in this smoke test,
neither do error conditions.

There are no known limitations or incomplete features. Error handling in the
program is done carefully; every system call that can result in an error is
checked for the error, and the program will exit with a return code of 5 (not
specified in the spec) if those fail.
