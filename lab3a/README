This is an implementation of Project 3A. The files included in this submission,
as reported by `tar tf *.tar.gz` are the following:

    README ............. This readme file
    Makefile ........... A Makefile to build the project
    lab3a.c ............ The C source code for the project
    ext2_fs.h .......... The provided header file

Additionally notes follow.

1. The given CSV is incorrect in several places. Care has been taken to follow
the format of the CSV instead of being absolutely correct. For example, the
number of blocks in the last group of a file system is computed by

    size_t last_group_block_count =
        (super->s_blocks_count - super->s_first_data_block) % super->s_blocks_per_group;

resulting in the result of 63 for the trivial file system. This is correct and
agrees with the `dumpe2fs` that comes with the `e2fsprogs` package. It also
logically makes sense because after all block 0 is blank. However to make sure
my program produces an output identical to the given sample, adjustments have
been made.

2. This project is boring and unenlightening. I recommend the TAs and the
professor discuss to replace this project with something more interesting in
the future.
